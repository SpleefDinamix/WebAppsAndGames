Food eaten by the player sometimes adds an extra score point to the player.
As a potentual result by:(server running on ~30 ticks but user runs faster/slower?)
Can be resolved by:(making the server take care of the player,but as a result more errors will accar.)
	!A temp. fix has been made using setTimeout and clearTimeout,but food next to each other will be calculated as one ,and the reason is clearTimeout as it fixes the 3*points bug.

Bots are stupid, they need to be more smarter.
Bots can't be removed, if doing so the console logs an error of not being able to read property .x and .y of 
"undefined" (the bots that are missing).

An immpruvement needs to be made with the Knockback of the player and the bots.
The player sometimes is  Knockbacked more then it should!
Bots always were not knockbacked as of in range of the players fuild of view!
Sometimes players are stuck in ongoing true statement of .hit property. 

A bug were the bots can't access the array that the server is providing the client as a result the client 
can't read properties. It needs pre-loading, but that is immposible as the server and client have 
different tick rates.(server: ~30 ,client - on-conection:~10-15 else:none).

And many more to be discoved :'( .
